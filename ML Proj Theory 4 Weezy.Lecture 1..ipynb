    "# Q1 What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "# ---> Subset of AI that refers to a set of Mathematical/Statistcal Algorithms & models to learn from data \n",
    "#      without being programmed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q2 Types of Machine Learning & there algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ---> 2.1.Supervised Learning.\n",
    "#          SL Algorithm here gives a robot an ability to Predict anything with high intelligence.\n",
    "#          SL algorithm is task driven, meaning it can Classify(identify fraud)/Predict(tell us weather tommorrow).\n",
    "#          SL = Regression(R) & Classification(C).\n",
    "#          SL Algorithms = KNN(C:Approximation), Linear Regression(R:Predicts desired output), Naive Bayes(C:Probabilisitc model).\n",
    "\n",
    "# ---> 2.2.Unsupervised Learning.\n",
    "#          UL algorithms are your Recommender Systems used in Youtube, Spotify, Netflix etc.\n",
    "#          Target Marketing uses UL Algorithms.\n",
    "#          UL learns with unlabled data, meaning you just give it data & it figures out the rest.\n",
    "#          UL Algorithms = Gaussian Mixture, Heirarchical Clustering, K-Means Clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ---> 2.3.Reinforcement Learning.\n",
    "#          Real time decision making.\n",
    "#          Game AI like AlphaGo,a compter programme built by google & it plays games(Chess,GO,Cards etc) at a super human level.\n",
    "#          Robot Navigation like Self Drving Cars they use RL Alg.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Q3 How does ML work?\n",
    "\n",
    "# ---> We must build a engine/ model that we must give lots & lots of data(pics of balls), so that it can learn from & create patterns.\n",
    "#      The patterns will help the machine tell us if this is a soccer ball/golf ball, depending on problem where solving.\n",
    "#      If we can give our machine a basket ball, the machine will tell us that its neither, since we have never trained it \n",

    "# Q4 What steps do you we take in a ML project?\n",
    "\n",
    "# ---> 1.Gather & Import data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ---> 2.Data Cleaning.\n",
    "#        Remove duplicates, outliers & deal with Null spaces.\n",
    "#        Normalisation.\n",
    "#        Unclean data will result in poor perf & wrong outputs from our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ---> 3.Split the data into Training(80%) & Testing(20%).\n",
    "\n",
    "# ---> 4.Model creation & selection.\n",
    "#        By model we refer to Algorithms, theres tons of Algorithms to use such as Decision Trees,SVM,KNN etc.\n",
    "#        Each model gives a different accuracy score, it all depends on a problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ---> 5.Train the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ---> 6.Make Predictions.\n",
    "#        Most of the time, predictions are not accurate, so we need step 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ---> 7.Evaluate & Improve.\n",
    "#        We do this by measuring Accuracy.\n",
    "#        We might select & replace an existing Algorithm with another Algorithms, so we can improve our Acc score.\n",
    "\n",
    "# ---> 8.Deploy & Maintain our model.\n",
    "#        We will cover this in the future, as it needs Cloud Computing knowledge.But deploying is the last step.\n",
